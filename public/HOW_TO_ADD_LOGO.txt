IMPORTANT: How to Add Your Logo Image

The image file should be placed DIRECTLY in the "public" folder, NOT in a subfolder.

CORRECT:
  public/
    └── logo_statue.png  ← Image file goes here directly

WRONG:
  public/
    └── logo_statue.png/  ← Don't create a folder with this name
        └── WhatsApp Image...jpeg  ← Don't put it inside a folder

STEPS:
1. Open the "public" folder
2. Place your image file directly in this folder
3. Name it exactly: logo_statue.png
   (Even if it's a .jpeg file, you can rename it to .png - browsers will still display it)

If your file is currently in a subfolder:
- Move it out of the subfolder
- Place it directly in the "public" folder
- Name it "logo_statue.png"

After placing the file:
- Refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R for hard refresh)
- The logo should appear in the Hero section
